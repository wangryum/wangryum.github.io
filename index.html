		<p>
			Welcome come to VLSI amusement my friend! This is Ryan, graduated from University of Michigan, majoring in IC&VLSI design. I'm currently an ASIC design engineer at Marvell technology. As a big fan of electrical and computer technology, I'd like to share with you what I know and what I'm interested in in this age of blooming technology.
